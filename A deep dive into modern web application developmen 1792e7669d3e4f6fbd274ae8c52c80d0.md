# A deep dive into modern web application development

# ****Full Stack open 2022****

**Get your hands on React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript! The course introduces modern web application development using JavaScript. The main focus is on single page applications implemented using the React library, and the REST interfaces implemented with Node.js that support them.**

# ****General****

**The course introduces modern web application development using JavaScript. The main focus is on single page applications implemented using the React library, and the REST interfaces implemented with Node.js that support them. The course also introduces you to the interface implementation principle of GraphQL, i.e. an alternative to REST**

**The course also covers application testing, configuration and management of execution environments, as well as the use of the MongoDB database to store the application's data**

Part 0

In this part, we first get to know the practices and the way the course is conducted. After that, we will take a look at the basics of web application development and the direction in which web application development has progressed in the last couple of ten years.

         **In this course, the use of the Chrome browser is recommended, as it offers the best tools for web application development.**

**The course assignments are returned to GitHub, so Git must be installed and you must know how to use it. Instructions for using Git can be found [here](https://github.com/mluukkai/ohjelmistotekniikka-kevat2019/blob/master/tehtavat/viikko1.md#gitin-alkeet) , for example .**

**Also install a reasonable text editor that supports web development, the more than recommended choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) .**

**Don't code with nano, Notepad or Gedit. Also, NetBeans is not at its best in web development and it is also unnecessarily heavy compared to e.g. Visual Studio Code.**

**Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer right away . The material is made with version 16.13.2, do not install an older version. There are installation instructions on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) .**

**[With Node, npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (originally short for *Node Package Manager* ) is also installed on the machine , which we will actively need during the course. With the latest Node, npx is also [installed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) , which is also needed a few times.**

# ****Operating principles of the web application****

**Before we start programming, we go through the operating principles of web applications by looking at the example application at [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp .](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp)**
